      <description>Background APM is the abbreviation for application performance monitoring. Currently, main APM functions lie in the performance diagnosis of distributed systems, including chain demonstration, application topology analysis and so on.
Apache ShardingSphere is not responsible for gathering, storing and demonstrating APM data, but sends the core information of SQL parsing and enforcement to APM to process. In other words, Apache ShardingSphere is only responsible for generating valuable data and submitting it to relevant systems through standard protocol.</description>
