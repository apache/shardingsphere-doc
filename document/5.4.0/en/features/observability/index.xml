      <description>Agent Based on bytecode enhancement and plugin design to provide tracing, metrics and logging features.
Only after the plugin of the Agent is enabled, the monitoring indicator data can be output to the third-party APM for display.
APM APM is an acronym for Application Performance Monitoring.
Focusing on the performance diagnosis of distributed systems, its main functions include call chain display, application topology analysis, etc.
Tracing Tracing data between distributed services or internal processes will be collected by agent.</description>
