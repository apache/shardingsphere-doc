      <description>Logic column It is used to calculate the encryption and decryption columns and it is the logical identifier of the column in SQL. Logical columns contain ciphertext columns (mandatory), query-helper columns (optional), and plaintext columns (optional).
Cipher column Encrypted data columns.
Query assistant column It is a helper column used for queries. For some non-idempotent encryption algorithms with higher security levels, irreversible idempotent columns are provided for queries.
Plain column The column is used to store plaintext and provide services during the migration of encrypted data.</description>

      <description> You need to process the original data on stocks in the database by yourself. The case-insensitive queries are not supported for encrypted fields. Comparison operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as GREATER THAN, LESS THAN, ORDER BY, BETWEEN, LIKE. Calculation operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as AVG, SUM, and computation expressions.  </description>

      <description>Unsupported SQL：
 The case-insensitive queries are not supported by encrypted fields. Comparison operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as GREATER THAN, LESS THAN, ORDER BY, BETWEEN, LIKE. Calculation operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as AVG, SUM, and computation expressions.  </description>
