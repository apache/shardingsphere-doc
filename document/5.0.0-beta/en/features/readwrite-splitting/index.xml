      <description>Primary Database It refers to the database used in data insertion, update and deletion. It only supports single primary database for now.
Replica Database It refers to the database used in data query. It supports multiple replica databases.
Primary Replica Replication It refers to the operation to asynchronously replicate data from the primary database to the replica database. Because of replica query asynchronization, there may be short-time data inconsistency between them.</description>

      <description>Supported Items  Provide the replica query configuration of one primary database with multiple replica databases, which can be used alone or with sharding table and database; Support SQL pass-through in independent use of replica query; If there is write operation in the same thread and database connection, all the following read operations are from the primary database to ensure data consistency; Forcible primary database route based on SQL Hint;  Unsupported Items  Data replication between the primary and the replica databases; Data inconsistency caused by replication delay between databases; Double or multiple primary databases to provide write operation; The data for transaction across primary and replica nodes are inconsistent.</description>
