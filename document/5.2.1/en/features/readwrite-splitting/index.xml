      <description>Primary database The primary database is used to add, update, and delete data operations. Currently, only single primary database is supported.
Secondary database The secondary database is used to query data operations and multi-secondary databases are supported.
Primary-Secondary synchronization It refers to the operation of asynchronously synchronizing data from a primary database to a secondary database. Due to the asynchronism of primary-secondary synchronization, data from the primary and secondary databases may be inconsistent for a short time.</description>

      <description> Data synchronization of primary and secondary databases is not supported. Data inconsistency resulting from data synchronization delays between primary and secondary databases is not supported. Multi-write of primary database is not supported. Transactional consistency between primary and secondary databases is not supported. In the primary-secondary model, both data reads and writes in transactions use the primary database.  </description>
