  - SQL 解析模块涉及的 `G4` 语法文件以及 `SQLVisitor` 实现类，需要根据如下的数据库关系进行差异代码标记。当数据库 A 不提供对应的数据库驱动和协议，而是直接使用数据库 B 的驱动和协议时，可以认为数据库 A 是数据库 B 的分支数据库。
 通常分支数据库会直接使用主干数据库的 SQL 解析逻辑，但是为了适配分支数据库的特有语法，部分分支数据库会从主干数据库复制并维护自己的 SQL 解析逻辑，此时对于分支数据库的特有语法，需要使用注释进行标记，其他部分需要和主干数据库的实现保持一致；

 ## Development Guidelines
 
- - Write codes with heart. Pursue clean, simplified and extremely elegant codes. Agree with concepts in &lt;Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code&gt; and &lt;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship&gt;.
- - Be familiar with codes already had, to keep consistent with the style and use.
- - Highly reusable, no duplicated codes or configurations.
- - Delete codes out of use in time.
+- **Dedication** Uphold a sense of responsibility and awe, continuously honing your craft.
+- **Readability** Code should be self-explanatory, revealing its purpose through reading, not debugging.
+- **Cleanliness** Embrace the principles of "Refactoring" and "Clean Code", striving for clean and elegant code.
+- **Consistency** Maintain complete consistency in code style, naming, and usage.
+- **Simplicity** Strive for minimalist code, conveying the correct meaning with the least amount of code. Aim for high reusability, no duplicate code or configurations. Promptly remove unused code.
+- **Abstraction** Ensure clear division of levels, reasonable abstraction of concepts. Maintain methods, classes, packages, and modules at the same level of abstraction.
+- **Excellence** Reject arbitrariness, every line of code, every character, every space must have its purpose.

A committer has the privilege to write and commit code and create pull requests to the default branch of the repository and in most cases, reviewers are also committers as you need to understand the code to review a PR.

 ### Why should I become a Committer?
+
 Committer activity is a good and useful endeavor: 
 - Being assigned to a Committer role is extremely motivating. A good open source community like Apache ShardingSphere appreciates your values and contributions, and you clearly see the results of your work in action.
 - Grow both professionally and personally very fast. 
 - Have an opportunity to connect with top professionals and also pull some cool ideas.
 - Being a Committer is good for CV building and even a greater plus for junior programmers.
