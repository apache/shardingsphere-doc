      <description>Since the SQL syntax is flexible and complex and distributed databases and stand-alone databases do not have identical query scenarios, SQLs incompatible with stand-alone databases are hard to avoid.
This document has listed identified supported SQL types and unsupported SQL types, trying to avoid traps for users.
It is inevitably to have some unlisted SQLs, welcome to supplement for that. We will also try to support those unavailable SQLs in future versions.</description>

      <description>Totally support pagination queries of MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle; partly support SQLServer pagination query due to its complexity.
Pagination Performance Performance Bottleneck Pagination with query offset too high can lead to a low data accessibility, take MySQL as an example:
SELECT * FROM t_order ORDER BY id LIMIT 1000000, 10 This SQL will make MySQL acquire another 10 records after skipping 1,000,000 records when it is not able to use indexes.</description>

      <description>ShardingSphere supports multiple dialects of SQL using different parsers. For specific SQL dialects that do not implement parsers, the default is to use the SQL92 standard for parsing.
Specific SQL dialect parser  PostgreSQL parser MySQL parser Oracle parser SQLServer parser  Note: MySQL parser supports MySQL, H2, and MariDB dialect.
Default SQL dialect parser Other SQL dialects, such as SQLite, Sybase, DB2 and Informix, are parsed by default using the standard of SQL92.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the RDL? RDL means rule definition language to create your distributed DBs, tables by SQL. In other words, this is a specific SQLs for ShardingSphere to inject some configurations. By means of RDL, users could inject data sources and configure sharding rules by SQL.
At present, there are the following RDLs,
 Create DATASOURCES to add database resources to ShardingSphere  // SQL CREATE DATASOURCES ( ds_key=host_name:host_port:db_name:user_name:pwd [, ds_key=host_name:host_port:db_name:user_name:pwd, .</description>
