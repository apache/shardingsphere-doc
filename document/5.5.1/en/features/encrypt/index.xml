      <description>Logic column It is used to calculate the encryption and decryption columns and it is the logical identifier of the column in SQL. Logical columns contain ciphertext columns (mandatory), query-helper columns (optional), like-query columns (optional), and plaintext columns (optional).
Cipher column Encrypted data columns.
Assisted query column It is a helper column used for queries. For some non-idempotent encryption algorithms with higher security levels, irreversible idempotent columns are provided for queries.</description>

      <description>You need to process the original data on stocks in the database by yourself. The like query supports %, _, but currently does not support escape. Case insensitive queries are not supported for the encrypted fields. Comparison operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as GREATER THAN, LESS THAN, ORDER BY, BETWEEN. Calculation operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as AVG, SUM, and computation expressions. When projection subquery contains encrypt column, you must use alias.</description>

      <description>Unsupported SQLï¼š
 The case-insensitive queries are not supported by encrypted fields. Comparison operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as GREATER THAN, LESS THAN, ORDER BY, BETWEEN. Calculation operations are not supported for encrypted fields, such as AVG, SUM, and computation expressions. SQL that contains encrypt column in subquery and uses asterisks for outer projection is not supported. SQL that contains encrypt column in UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT statements is not supported.</description>
