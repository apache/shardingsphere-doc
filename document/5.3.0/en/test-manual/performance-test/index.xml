      <description>Objectives Compare the performance of ShardingSphere-Proxy and MySQL
 Sysbench directly carries out stress testing on the performance of MySQL. Sysbench directly carries out stress testing on ShardingSphere-Proxy (directly connect MySQL).  Based on the above two groups of experiments, we can figure out the loss of MySQL when using ShardingSphere-Proxy.
Set up the test environment Server information  Db-related configuration: it is recommended that the memory is larger than the amount of data to be tested, so that the data is stored in the memory hot block, and the rest can be adjusted.</description>

      <description>Objective BenchmarkSQL tool is used to test the sharding performance of ShardingSphere-Proxy.
Method ShardingSphere-Proxy supports the TPC-C test through BenchmarkSQL 5.0. In addition to the content described in this document, BenchmarkSQL is operated according to the original document HOW-TO-RUN.txt.
Fine tuning to test tools Unlike stand-alone database stress testing, distributed database solutions inevitably face trade-offs in functions. It is recommended to make the following adjustments when using BenchmarkSQL to carry out stress testing on ShardingSphere-Proxy.</description>
