 Next, let’s still take the SQL statement as an example and provide specific code to show how `Visitor` formats it.
 
 `MySQLFormatSQLVisitor` is used to visit SQL. Based on the `DEBUG` code, we can clearly see the execution path of this visit as shown in the figure below. Visitor traverses all parts of the syntax tree, and ANTLR4 generates default methods for visiting each node according to the defined grammar rules. Apache ShardingSphere leverages key methods and successfully develops complete the SQL formatting function.
