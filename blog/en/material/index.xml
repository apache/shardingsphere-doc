      <title>How to construct the distributed database</title>
      <link>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/en/material/database/</link>

      <description>Author | Liang Zhang
Relational databases have dominated the database field for the past few decades, and the stability, security, and ease of use they bring have become the cornerstone for building modern systems. With the rapid development of the Internet, the database structured in a stand-alone system has been unable to meet the increasingly high concurrent requests and increasingly large data storage needs, therefore, distributed database are more widely adopted.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to DistSQL</title>
      <link>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/en/material/jul_26_an_introduction_to_distsql/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/en/material/jul_26_an_introduction_to_distsql/</guid>
      <description>We believe that if you’re reading this then you’re familiar with SQL (Structured Query Language), the data query and programming language. It’s also used as the standard language of relational database management systems for accessing data, querying, updating and managing relational database systems.
Similar to standard SQL, DistSQL, or Distributed SQL, is a built-in SQL language unique to ShardingSphere that provides incremental functional capabilities beyond standard SQL. Leveraging ShardingSphere&amp;rsquo;s powerful SQL parsing engine, DistSQL provides a syntax structure and syntax validation system like that of standard SQL - making DistSQL more flexible while maintaining regularity.</description>

      <title>ShardingSphere’s Metadata Loading Process</title>
      <link>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/en/material/oct_12_1_shardingspheres_metadata_loading_process/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/en/material/oct_12_1_shardingspheres_metadata_loading_process/</guid>
      <description>1. Overview
Metadata is the data that constitutes the data. In database terms, any data that describes the database is metadata. Column names, database names, usernames, table names, etc. and data customization library tables that store information about database objects are metadata. ShardingSphere core functions such as data sharding, encryption and decryption are all based on the database metadata.
This shows that metadata is the core of the ShardingSphere system and is also the core data of every data storage related middleware or component.</description>

      <description>Integrating SCTL into RAL In the previous article “An Introduction to DistSQL” written by Haoran Meng, the Apache ShardingSphere Committer shared the motivating reasons behind the design of DistSQL, explained its syntax system, and impressively showcased how you can use one SQL to create a sharding table.
Recently, the ShardingSphere community has redesigned the SCTL grammar and the execution engine, integrating SCTL into the DistSQL syntax system. Now RAL contains the old SCTL function, making ShardingSphere&amp;rsquo;s command language even more convenient for database management.</description>

      <description>Background Apache ShardingSphere has gradually introduced various features based on practical user requirements, such as data sharding and read/write splitting.
The data sharding feature contains many practical sharding strategies such as Standard Sharding Strategy and Complex Sharding Strategy, and users can easily configure the corresponding sharding algorithms.
When it comes to Read/Write Splitting, Apache ShardingSphere provides users with two types called Static and Dynamic, and abundant load balancing algorithms.
Sharding and Read/Write Splitting functions of ShardingSphere are already very useful, but scenarios are ever-changing.</description>

      <description>This post analyzes ops &amp;amp; maintenance solutions with experiences taken from real production scenarios for data sharding and other functions provided by ShardingSphere-Proxy Version 5.1.0.
 Unless otherwise specified, in the following examples, when we say “database” we refer to MySQL.
 What does ShardingSphere-Proxy do? ShardingSphere-Proxy allows users to use Apache ShardingSphere just as if it were a native database.
To gain a better understanding of what’s ShardingSphere-proxy, let’s take a look at its definition provided, by Apache ShardingSphere’s official website:</description>

      <description>Background and Challenges Zhuanzhuan is an internet platform that allows it users to sell their second-hand stuff — sort of an eBay of the East. Its business had been booming, and with it the ordering system started to face increasing performances challenges. The order database is the cornerstone of the system, and its performance should not be underestimated.
Challenges:
 During promotions and special discount periods the burden on databases is heaby with tens of thousands of single database queries per second (qps) taking up huge database resources, and causing a significant reduction in write performance.</description>

      <description>Background For a long time, unification or fragmentation were the two most popular predictions for the future of databases. With the advance of digitization, a single scenario cannot meet the needs of diversified applications — making database fragmentation an irreversible trend. While Oracle, the commercial database with the largest market share, has no obvious weaknesses, all sorts of new databases are still entering the market. Today, over 300 databases are ranked on DB-Engines.</description>

      <description>With increasing amounts of data and increasing traffic load, business systems are facing significant challenges, and a strong demand for the scalability of database systems has emerged. Problems in online scaling of traditional standalone databases such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL is now more evident than ever. In such cases, the distributed database that can scale out was conceived to solve these scaling challenges. All of this means that distributed transactions are a problem that must be tackled.</description>

      <description>The FMCG (fast moving consumer-goods) industry can no longer meet current development requirements. The traditional way of only upgrading the end of the supply chain cannot achieve high-quality business development. Huimin focuses on order fulfillment and delivery service for over one million community supermarkets, transforming and upgrading from serving retail terminal stores to promoting the digitization of the whole FMCG industry chain.
It is committed to building a B2B2C data closed-loop operating system, providing brand owners, distributors, and community supermarkets with transformed and upgraded solutions for the whole chain covering purchasing, marketing, operation, and distribution.</description>

      <description>Why do we need to format code? Simply put, it’s to make code easier to read, understand, and modify.
As a Top-Level Apache open source project, ShardingSphere has 400 contributors as of today. Since most developers do not have the same coding style, it is not easy to standardize the project’s overall code format in a GitHub open collaboration model. To solve this issue, ShardingSphere uses Spotless to unify code formatting.</description>

      <description>Why learn ShardingSphere’s SPI? You might already be familiar with Java and Dubbo’s SPI (Service Provider Interface) mechanism, so you may wonder “why would I learn about ShardingSphere’s SPI mechanism?” The reasons are quite simple:
 ShardingSphere’s source code is simpler and easier to adapt. The execution of ShardingSphere’s SPI mechanism is quite smooth, with less code required for day-to-day operations. Unlike Dubbo’s SPI mechanism and its additional features related to IoC, the one in ShardingSphere only preserves the fundamental structure, making it effortless to use.</description>

      <description>ShardingSphere-Proxy, positioned as a transparent database proxy, is one of Apache ShardingSphere’s access points.
ShardingSphere-Proxy implements a database protocol that can be accessed by any client using or compatible with MySQL / PostgreSQL / openGauss protocols. The advantage of ShardingSphere-Proxy over ShardingSphere-JDBC is the support for heterogeneous languages and the operable entry point to the database cluster for DBAs.
Similar to ShardingSphere’s SQL parsing module, establishing ShardingSphere-Proxy’s support for database protocols is a long-term process that requires developers to continuously improve the database protocol deployment.</description>

      <description>For those of you who often use databases, you may wonder:
  How do I check what SQL is currently being executed by the database, and in what state?
  How do I terminate abnormal SQL? For instance, if a SELECT statement used to query a table with massive data does not carry query conditions, it would drag down the performance of the entire database. This may push to want to terminate this abnormal SQL.</description>

      <description>1. Background Thanks to our continuous review of the ShardingSphere&amp;rsquo;s community feedback that we use to develop features such as data sharding and read/write splitting, we found that some users create a large number of shards when using the data sharding feature.
In such cases, there can be 1,000 physical tables corresponding to a sharding logical table, which largely disturbs users.
For instance, a SELECT * FROM t_order statement will lead to a full-route, which is obviously not the case for OLTP.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s AWS CloudFormation? AWS CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code (IaC) service that allows you to easily model, provision, and manage all the cloud services provided by AWS by custom templates.
Traditionally, when we create a new architecture, we need to manually configure it in AWS step by step which can cause some errors such forgetting some steps.
Now with CloudFormation, we can use declarative configuration to define resources and then create and manage them without worrying about the dependency order of the resources.</description>

      <description>1. Background Apache ShardingSphere supports data encryption. By parsing users&#39; SQL input and rewriting the SQL according to the users&#39; encryption rules, the original data is encrypted and stored with ciphertext data in the underlying database at the same time.
When a user queries the data, it only fetches the ciphertext data from the database, decrypts it, and finally returns the decrypted original data to the user. However, because the encryption algorithm encrypts the whole string, fuzzy queries cannot be achieved.</description>

      <description>Database protocols are considered relatively unknown knowledge for most developers. Generally, users and developers use databases through off-the-shelf database clients and drivers, without manipulating database protocols directly.
However, having some basic understanding of the features and processes of database protocols can help developers provide some ideas to identify troubleshooting problems when it comes to database functionality and performance issues.
In this post, we will introduce the features of commonly used open source database protocols such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, and explain how ShardingSphere-Proxy interacts with clients at the database protocol level.</description>

      <description>Before 5.3.0, ShardingSphere-JDBC supported Java API, YAML, Spring Boot Starter, and Spring Namespace.
However, compatibility with Spring has brought the following challenges to the community:
 Many configuration files need to be adjusted when adding or updating API, which causes a heavy workload. The community needs to maintain lots of configuration documents and examples. Spring Bean life cycle management is susceptible to other project dependencies, such as PostProcessor.[1][2] Spring Boot Starter and Spring Namespace&amp;rsquo;s style differs from YAML in ShardingSphere.</description>
