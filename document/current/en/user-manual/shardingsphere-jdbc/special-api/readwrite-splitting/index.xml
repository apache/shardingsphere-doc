      <description>Background Apache ShardingSphere uses ThreadLocal to manage primary database routing marks for mandatory routing. A primary database routing mark can be added to HintManager through programming, and this value is valid only in the current thread. Apache ShardingSphere can also route the primary database by adding comments to SQL.
Hint is mainly used to perform mandatory data operations in the primary database under the read/write splitting scenarios.
Procedure  Call HintManager.</description>
