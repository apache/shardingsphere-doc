      <description>Target The performance of ShardingSphere-JDBC, ShardingSphere-Proxy and MySQL would be compared here. INSERT &amp;amp; UPDATE &amp;amp; DELETE which regarded as a set of associated operation and SELECT which focus on sharding optimization are used to evaluate performance for the basic scenarios (single route, readwrite-splitting &amp;amp; encrypt &amp;amp; sharding, full route). While another set of associated operation, INSERT &amp;amp; SELECT &amp;amp; DELETE, is used to evaluate performance for readwrite-splitting. To achieve the result better, these tests are performed with jmeter which based on a certain amount of data with 20 concurrent threads for 30 minutes, and one MySQL has been deployed on one machine, while the scenario of MySQL used for comparison is deployed on one machine with one instance.</description>

      <description>At least 5 machines are required:
Jenkins * 1: ${host-jenkins} Sysbench * 1: ${host-sysbench} ShardingSphere-Proxy * 1: ${host-proxy} MySQL Server * 2: ${host-mysql-1}, ${host-mysql-2} The hardware standards of Jenkins and Sysbench machines can appropriately lower.
Software Environment Jenkins: The latest version Sysbench: 1.0.20 ShardingSphere-Proxy: package from master branch MySQL Server: 5.7.28 Test Program According to the above hardware environment, the configuration parameters are as follows, and the parameters should be adjusted according to the changes in the hardware environment.</description>
