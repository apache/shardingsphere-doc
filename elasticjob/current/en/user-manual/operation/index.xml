      <description>Application deployment  Start the ZooKeeper of the ElasticJob designated registry. Run the jar file containing ElasticJob and business code. It is not limited to the startup mode of jar or war. When the job server is configured with multiple network cards, the network card address can be specified by setting the system variable elasticjob.preferred.network.interface or specify network addresses by setting the system variable elasticjob.preferred.network.ip. ElasticJob obtains the first non-loopback available IPV4 address in the network card list by default.</description>
