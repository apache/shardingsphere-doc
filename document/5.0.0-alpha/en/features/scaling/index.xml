      <description>Scaling Job It refers one complete process of scaling data from old sharding rules to new sharding rule.
Data Node Same as the Data Node in sharding/SQL.
Inventory Data It refers all existing data stored in data nodes before the scaling job started.
Incremental Data It refers the new data generated by application during scaling job.</description>

      <description>Principle Description Consider about these challenges of ShardingSphere-Scaling, the solution is: Use two database clusters temporarily, and switch after the scaling is completed.
Advantages:
 No effect for origin data during scaling. No risk for scaling failure. No limited by sharding strategies.  Disadvantagesï¼š
 Redundant servers during scaling. All data needs to be moved.  ShardingSphere-Scaling will analyze the sharding rules and extract information like datasource and data nodes. According the sharding rules, ShardingSphere-Scaling create a scaling job with 4 main phases.</description>
