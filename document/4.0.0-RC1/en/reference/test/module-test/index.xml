      <description>Prepare Data Not like Integration test, SQL parse test does not need a specific database environment, just define the sql to parse, and the assert data:
SQL Data As mentioned sql-case-id in Integration test, test-case-id could be shared in different module to test, and the file is at shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/main/resources/sql/supported/${SQL-TYPE}/*.xml
Assert Data The assert data is at shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/main/resources/case/${SQL-TYPE}/*.xml in that xml file, it could assert against the table name, token or sql condition and so on.</description>

      <description>Target Facing logic databases and tables cannot be executed directly in actual databases. SQL rewrite is used to rewrite logic SQL into rightly executable ones in actual databases, including two parts, correctness rewrite and optimization rewrite. rewrite tests are for these targets.
Test The rewrite tests are in the test folder under sharding-core/sharding-core-rewrite . Followings are the main part for rewrite tests:
 test engine environment configuration assert data  Test engine is the entrance of rewrite tests, just like other test engines, through Junit Parameterized, read every and each data in the xml file under the target test type in test\resources, and then assert by the engine one by one</description>
